# Deep Text Generation 📝
> Experimenting with small deep learning models for natural text generation

## ToDo
- [x] implement word-based model
- [x] implement char-based model
- [ ] try exponential LR decay 
- [ ] try subword tokenizer
- [ ] implement temperature
- [ ] try [keras mini GPT example](https://keras.io/examples/generative/text_generation_with_miniature_gpt/)
